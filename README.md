# Hi there ðŸ‘‹, this is Wangyang Wang
Iâ€™m currently in my fourth year of undergraduate studies at Tianjin University :school:, majoring in Computer Science. I'm supervised by Prof.[Qilong Wang](https://csqlwang.github.io/homepage/) to complete my undergraduate project. Next year, I will start to pursue my master's degree with him.

My research interest includes Computer Vision (CV) and Architecture Design & Optimization. Iâ€™m currently learning compression methods based on the ViT.

I'm still learning about the CV field, and I'm just open-sourcing some of the project source code I've implemented here. If you have any questions, feel free to discuss with me. :wink:
